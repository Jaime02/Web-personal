  <h2 id="technical-drawing-app">Technical drawing app</h2>
  <p>2020 - This is my biggest project I have ever done so far. It is focused in the technical drawing class that
    students take during high school.
    The app has been built using Python 3. It uses <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">PyQt5</a> for the GUI
    and <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> for the 3D drawing.
    It also uses <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">Sympy</a> for some geometrical
    calculations.

  <p>I uploaded two videos about the technical drawing project I did. I also uploaded some traditional songs of my
    village.</p>

  <h2 id="qt">Qt</h2>
  <p>I have been using Qt for a while. It is a extremely powerful framework which provides GUI features
    and much more. I find it very complete and easy to use. It has three big language APIs: C++, QML and Python.</p>
  <p>I love the Python bindings of the C++ API, which are called "PySide." The combination of the
    capabilities of Qt and the development speed of Python is amazing. I have little experience with C++ as I prefer
    using
    Python. I would like to learn QML in-depth.</p>

  <p>I took part in the 2021 Hacktoberferst with the Python Spain Discord community and I contributed to
    the Qt documentation, translating some C++ examples to Python. It has been an amazing experience to learn how to
    carry out all of the process. I cloned both the C++ and Python repositories, I set up my Gerrit and Git 
    enviromnent properly (which was the hardest part of all the process), I transpiled the examples carefuly and I 
    pushed the work, which is already merged.
    The best part of the experience is meeting a lot of amazing people and receiving feedback. I really encourage people
    to get into contributing to open source projects such as Qt, it is very enjoyable.
  </p>
  <p>Due to my contributions, I got elected as one of the <a
      href="https://www.qt.io/blog/welcome-to-our-qt-champions-for-2021#:~:text=We%20also%20have,both%20of%20you!">Qt
      2021 champions!</a></p>

  <h2 id="qt-quicksort">Qt QuickSort</h2>
  <p>
    2021 - In my second year of university, I coded a QuickSort algorithm simulation using PySide6. That way I learned
    how QuickSort works and I helped my classmates to achieve the same goal. The result is quite beautiful, but I did
    not have much time to polish the project due to university tasks.

  <p>Fiverr is an online marketplace that links freelancers to clients. It is reliable and takes a 20%
    comission. I joined it a while ago, and I have made some money from it by doing projects such as a task manager
    and an audio frequency analyzer. Feel free to contact me if you need help with anything.
