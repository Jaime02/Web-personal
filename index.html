      <h2>Technical drawing app</h2>
      <p class="texto">2020 - This is my biggest project I have ever done so far. It is focused in the technical drawing subject that students take during high school.
         The app has been built using Python 3. It uses <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">PyQt5</a> for the GUI and <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> for the 3D drawing. 
         It also uses <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">Sympy</a> for some geometrical calculations.

      <h2>Qt</h2>
      <p class="texto">I have been using Qt for a while. It is a extremely powerful framework which provides GUI features and much more. I find it very complete and easy to use. It has three big language APIs: C++, QML and Python.</p>
      <p class="texto">I love the Python bindings of the C++ API, which are called "PySide". The combination of the capabilities of Qt and the usability of Python is amazing. I have few experience with C++ because I prefer using Python. I would like to learn QML in depth.</p>

      <p class="texto">I took part in the 2021 Hacktoberferst with the Python Spain discord community and I contributed to the Qt documentation translating some C++ examples to Python. It has been a amazing experience to learn how to carry out all the process.
        The best part of the experience is knowing a lot of amazing people and receive feedback. I really encourage people to get contributing into open source projects such as Qt, it is very enjoyable. 
      </p>
      <p class="texto">Due to my contributions, I got elected as one of <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/welcome-to-our-qt-champions-for-2021#:~:text=We%20also%20have,both%20of%20you!">Qt 2021 champions!</a></p>
